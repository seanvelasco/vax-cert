### Note
First wep app I made while learning React and JavaScript during the pandemic.
In 2020, this was the only project I had before I joined a health tech YC company.
Also serves as a remembrance of the CRA days.
Continually get updates for resolving security vulnerabilities and latest developments in ECMAScript and React.
